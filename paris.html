        <h2>Trip Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Paris feels like a city full of art, history, and beautiful views, so
          I imagine spending several days walking around, visiting museums,
          sitting in cafés, and exploring different neighborhoods. I want to see
          the famous landmarks, but also enjoy slow mornings, street markets,
          and smaller cultural spots that make the city feel unique.

          />
          <h3>Landmarks</h3>
          <p>
            The Eiffel Tower, the Louvre, Notre-Dame, and the Arc de Triomphe are
            classic stops. I’d love to see them, but also find smaller plazas and
            quiet viewpoints that aren’t crowded with tourists.

          <h3>Cafés & Bakeries</h3>
          <p>
            Coffee with a view of the street, fresh baguettes, croissants, and
            desserts lined up behind glass spending a slow morning in a Parisian
            café is high on my list.

          <h3>Neighborhood Walks</h3>
          <p>
            From Montmartre to the Latin Quarter, I want to wander through
            neighborhoods to see everyday life: balconies, flower boxes, small
            shops, and winding streets.

          <h3>Evening Views</h3>
          <p>
            In the evenings, I imagine walking along the Seine, listening to street
            music, and watching the city lights reflect on the water and bridges.

          If I ever make it there, I want simple days walking along the river,
          reading on a bench, trying pastries, and watching life unfold from café
          windows.

        <h2>Longer-Term Travel Notes</h2>
        <p>
          I don’t have firm plans to visit Paris yet, but I’m slowly gathering
          ideas. As I learn more about transportation, seasons, and
          neighborhoods, I’ll add packing lists, walking routes, and sample
          itineraries here.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, this section is a place for rough notes, half-formed plans,
          and inspiration enough text to keep the page full and readable while
          I keep researching and dreaming about a future trip.
