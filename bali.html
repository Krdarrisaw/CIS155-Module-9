        <h2>Trip Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Bali looks peaceful and inspiring, so I would plan this trip to slow
          down and enjoy nature. My days might include beaches, rice terraces,
          local food, and time spent in quiet temples or villages. It seems like
          a place where I could relax, connect with culture, and enjoy warm
          scenery at my own pace.

          <h2>Why Bali?</h2>
          <p>
            Bali is known for its beaches, temples, art, and peaceful
            atmosphere. It’s a place I imagine visiting when I want a mix of
            relaxation, nature, and unique cultural experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            The island offers countless things to see—rice terraces,
            waterfalls, street food, local craft markets, and small villages
            full of traditional architecture. There’s also a thriving yoga and
            meditation culture.

          <h3>Travel Notes</h3>
          <p>
            Bali seems like the kind of place where each day can shift between
            calm and adventure. I’d want to spend the mornings exploring quiet
            temples, the afternoons by the ocean, and the evenings trying local
            food or watching traditional dance performances.
