        <h2>Trip Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I would like to spend about a week in Tokyo exploring both busy areas
          and quiet local neighborhoods. My trip would include seeing iconic
          places like Shibuya Crossing, historic temples, themed shops, and
          late-night food spots. I want to experience the fast energy of the
          city while still finding peaceful parks and smaller streets where
          everyday life happens.
        </p>

      <div class="tokyo-layout">
        <section class="tokyo-column">
          <h2>Why Tokyo?</h2>
          <p>
            Tokyo feels like a blend of the future and deep tradition. Neon
            signs, quiet temples, arcade noise, and tiny ramen shops often share
            the same street.
          </p>
          <p>
            I imagine getting lost in side streets, wandering into bookstores
            and small cafes, and watching people rush by at Shibuya Crossing.
            Tokyo seems like a city that never stops moving.
          </p>

          <h3>Must-See Spots</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Shibuya Crossing and Hachikō statue</li>
            <li>Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa</li>
            <li>Akihabara for games and anime</li>
            <li>TeamLab Planets or teamLab Borderless</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Food & Everyday Life</h2>
          <p>
            I want to try ramen, okonomiyaki, konbini snacks, and matcha
            desserts. Convenience stores in Japan are famous for having
            surprisingly good food, and I’d love to see if that’s true.
          </p>
          <p>
            I’m just as interested in quieter neighborhoods: small parks, local
            bakeries, and residential streets where people actually live their
            everyday lives.
          </p>

          <h3>What My Perfect Day in Tokyo Looks Like</h3>
          <p>
            Morning in Asakusa, afternoon in Akihabara, and an evening walk
            through Shinjuku before heading back to the hotel. And maybe a
            late-night bowl of ramen.
