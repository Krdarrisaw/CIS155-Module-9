Because I didnt get peer repsonese im using instrutor feed back on all of my work.

Feedback: OK! Color scheme: a bit corporate boring. It looks like something for an airline booking site. 
Bump up color.
Fix: completely reworked the color palatte.

Feedback2: Add dynamic photos. I would like to see more interactivity/snazzyness in the menu as well

Fix: Added a variety of photos for each location.
